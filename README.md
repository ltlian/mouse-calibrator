# mouse-calibrator
A small utility for normalizing mouse sensitivity between first person games

## Usage
The utility will fire off a set amount of mickeys when pressing the left or right arrow keys. After finding a value that represents a perfect 360 degree turn in whatever game that uses the preferred sensitivity, other games can be configured based on this value.
